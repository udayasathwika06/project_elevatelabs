# 🛍️ Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis

## 📌 Objective
To analyze transactional retail data and uncover:
- Profit-draining product categories
- Inventory turnover inefficiencies
- Seasonal trends in product performance

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **SQL**: Data cleaning, profit margin computation
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)**: Correlation analysis and data exploration
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboard with filters for region, product type, and season

## 📂 Dataset
- `retail_transaction_data.csv`: Contains transactional records with product, region, and profitability details

## 🧪 Steps Performed

### 1. Data Preparation in SQL
- Imported the dataset into SQL
- Cleaned missing/null records  
- Created table: `retail_transactions`
- Ran SQL queries to calculate:
  - Profit Margin by **Category**
  - Profit Margin by **Sub-Category**

### 2. Python-Based Analysis
- Analyzed correlation between **Inventory_Days** and **Profitability**
- Visualized patterns and relationships using **Seaborn**

### 3. Tableau Dashboard
- Built a dashboard showing:
  - Profitability by category, region, and season
  - Filters for Region, Product Category/Sub-Category, Season
- Enabled interactive filtering and strategic KPI insights

### 4. Strategic Recommendations
- Identified slow-moving & overstocked items
- Suggested:
  - Focused discounting
  - Optimized inventory & supply chain handling
  - Seasonal bundling strategies
